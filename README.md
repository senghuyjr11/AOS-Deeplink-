# AOS-Deeplink-

Android demo project showcasing how to implement and handle deep links using Kotlin.

## Overview

**AOS-Deeplink-** demonstrates the setup and management of Android deep links, allowing users and external sources (such as browsers or other apps) to navigate directly to specific content or screens within your app. This approach enhances user experience and facilitates seamless integration with the Android ecosystem.

## Features

- Deep link support for launching specific activities or fragments
- Complete implementation in Kotlin
- Easy-to-understand structure for quick integration into other Android projects
- Sample Manifest and intent filter setup

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin (100%)
- Android SDK
- AndroidX libraries

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Electric Eel or newer)
- Android device or emulator (API level 21+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senghuyjr11/AOS-Deeplink-.git
   ```
2. **Open in Android Studio:**
   - File > Open > Select the cloned `AOS-Deeplink-` directory

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Click "Run" or press `Shift + F10` to launch on your device/emulator

### Usage

- Install and open the app.
- Test deep links by launching URLs registered in `AndroidManifest.xml` (e.g., using `adb shell` or clicking links in a browser).
- Observe how the app navigates directly to specific screens based on the incoming deep link.

## Project Structure

- `MainActivity.kt` — Entry point and deep link handler
- `AndroidManifest.xml` — Intent filter and deep link configuration
- `res/layout/` — User interface layouts
